                        <p>I am currently located in the <span>Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area</span> but I grew up in San Diego, California and Spokane, Washington. My interest in web development began around 2013 when I was just a 15 year old trying to customize my Tumblr blog theme. Once I saw the pages were made with HTML, I was fascinated and instantly started my research to see how it works and one thing led to another. With college classes, coding bootcamps, freelance work, and python teaching assistant experience under my belt I am confident in my abilities, although Iâ€™ll always have the inclination to keep learning and growing in this ever-changing field. </p>
